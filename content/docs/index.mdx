# Kun (كن)

**Remote AI Development Infrastructure**

> "كن" (Kun) - "Be!" - The divine command of creation from the Quran.
> This infrastructure embodies the architecture-first paradigm where AI generates code within intentional constraints.

## Executive Summary

**Kun** (كن - Arabic for "Be!") is a remote AI development infrastructure that enables distributed teams to access Claude Code from anywhere while maintaining architectural consistency through shared patterns, centralized configuration, and intentional constraints.

The name reflects the Quranic command of creation - the word by which God creates. Similarly, this infrastructure embodies the architecture-first paradigm where humans design systems and AI generates code within those intentional boundaries.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

| Problem | Impact | Severity |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Fragmented Environments** | "Works on my machine" syndrome | Critical |
| **AI Context Loss** | Each Claude session starts fresh, losing team patterns | High |
| **Mobile Inaccessibility** | Cannot develop or review from phones | Medium |
| **Pattern Inconsistency** | AI generates different code styles per developer | High |
| **No Scalability Path** | Team tool cannot become commercial platform | Medium |

## Vision Statement

> Build a centralized development environment where AI works within intentional architectural constraints, enabling any team member to create production-quality software from any device.

## Three Phases

<Structure />

## Quick Start (Phase 1)

```bash
# Install Tailscale
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh

# Enable SSH
sudo tailscale up --ssh

# Start tmux session
tmux new-session -d -s claude -n claude

# Connect from mobile with Termius using your Tailscale IP
```

## Target Users

### Phase 1: Individual Developer
- Wants persistent Claude Code sessions
- Needs mobile access for on-the-go development
- Values pattern consistency

### Phase 2: Team (10+ Developers)
- 10+ developers across locations
- Using shared patterns from databayt/codebase
- Need consistent AI context across team

### Phase 3: External Clients
- Renting compute + patterns
- Want pre-configured AI development stack
- Pay per usage

## Philosophy

> "The future of software is not just written. It's designed." - Craig Adam

Kun represents the shift from "vibe coding" to intentional architecture:
- **Speed without chaos**: AI generates fast, but within constraints
- **Patterns as training data**: Every good function teaches the next generation
- **Direction over velocity**: Move fast, but with a map
